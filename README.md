### Hey there, I'm Matheus "Set" Inacio! :grimacing:

I'm an enthusiast developer, currently learning more about JavaScript and getting cozy with the MERN stack.

I have studied C# and Unity in the past, after pivoting my career.

Soon I'll be in a bootcamp at the awesome [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/)!

If you want to get in contact with me, you can do so through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inaciomatheusdev/).
