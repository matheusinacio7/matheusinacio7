### Hey there, I'm Matheus "Set" Inacio! :grimacing:

I'm a developer, currently learning more about JavaScript and TypeScript.
I've got some skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript + some frameworks/etc like Node, Express, Puppeteer, React.

I have studied C# and Unity in the past, after dropping my previous career as a high school tutor.

Currently studying at the awesome school [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).

If you want to get in contact with me, you can do so through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inaciomatheusdev/).
