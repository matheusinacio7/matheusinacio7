### Hey there, I'm Matheus "Set" Inacio! :grimacing:

I am a developer, currently working mostly with TypeScript and React (+ NextJS).

I also have a strong passion for gaming and game development and have studied C# and Unity in the past, after dropping my previous career as a high school tutor.

Currently at [Sitemate](https://sitemate.com), working to revolutionize the construction industry through technology.

If you want to get in contact with me, you can do so through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inaciomatheusdev/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/heyset_).
