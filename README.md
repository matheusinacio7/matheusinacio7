### Hey there, I'm Matheus "Set" Inacio! :grimacing:

I am a developer, currently working mostly with TypeScript and React (+ NextJS).

I also have a strong passion for gaming and game development and have studied C# and Unity in the past, after dropping my previous career as a high school tutor.

Currently working as a Frontend Developer at [Flow](https://flowpodcast.com.br), platform for one of the largest Brazilian podcasts; and studying at the awesome school [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).

If you want to get in contact with me, you can do so through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inaciomatheusdev/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/heyset_).
